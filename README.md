# weather
 - Create an endpoint in node that accepts minimum two cities and then calls an open weather API (ie. /endpoint/cities/toronto|chicago )
 - Get the temperature for the two different cities
 - Store them in mongo
 - Return a JSON response with http status 200 if everything was OK
 - Don't forget the city and temp info in the response!
 
 Assuming this application was running on port 9000, show us an NGINX configuration that would handle proxying this request.
